My name is Melody Shao and I am currently a full time student majoring in Economics/ Administrative Studies at University of California, Riverside. Outside of school, I work part-time at Kumon (a tutoring center) and I also do work at a family member’s business, Peak Laboratories, where I learn important skills such as navigating Excel, profit and loss statements, etc. Other than that, I spend a lot of my time on a ranch taking care of and riding horses. 
Working at Kumon has taught me how to successfully host and navigate zoom meetings since most interactions I have with children are through a screen these days. I have also learned to use Excel to enter information about the children which will be helpful to me in the future. Besides these technical skills, working at Kumon has taught me to teach and interact with young children and to be patient with the learning process. 
At Peak Laboratories, I learned to analyze a profit and loss statement and how to compare one year against another to determine which year was most profitable. I also have learned to complete tasks such as finding vendors for specific components of Peak Laboratories’ products and also communicating with other businesses to fulfill tasks such as finding a new shipping company with certain requirements. As I learn new things, I sharpen my skills on Excel and gain experience looking at the inner workings of a small business. 
<br><br>
Due to quarantine, I am not able to do many things I would like to just like most of the world. One of the things I plan on doing once life transitions back to normal is starting a club at school. My friend and I had started a club back in high school that worked with the non-profit organization, Namaste Direct. We raised money in order to send loans to the women of Guatemala who are looking to get better educated and start their own businesses. We hope to help end the cycle of poverty through education of these women and their children and support the growth of their businesses. I would like to continue this club at the university of california, riverside as a sister club to the one my friend will be starting at her own school. Someday, my friend and I hope to start our own non-profit organization and work on breaking the cycle of poverty around the world. 
<br><br>
Outside of work and school, I work on a ranch and take care of horses. I have learned so much from handling horses. The ranch is where I gained a lot of confidence in myself and where I strengthened my mind. I had to figure out a lot of things for myself and learn through experience which although at first caused a lot of stress and anxiety, I learned to trust myself and to relax my mind and body in stressful situations. Once I am able to do that, I can focus myself with the task at hand.
